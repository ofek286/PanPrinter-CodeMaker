# PanPrinter-CodeMaker
The repo of the CodeMaker code of The PanPrinter project

The CodeMaker is the Java program that helps create print files from a drawing


This project is about creating a Pancake "printer" with Arduino Mega.

The printer is able to make the pancake in shapes, and even custom-made shapes that can even give several areas different colors (the time spent on the pan changes the color of the area).

The printer understands shapes sent in OSGrid, a programming-language of some sort, I invented for this project.
OSGrid looks similar to Assembly - command [arg1[,arg2]].
